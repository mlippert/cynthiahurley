Cynthia Hurley Fine Wines Source Repository
===========================================

[Cynthia Hurley Fine Wines][CHFW Web] (AKA CHFW or CHW) is a wine importer company owned
by Angelo Manioudakis a friend of Gillian Lippert.

I (Mike Lippert) have been working w/ Gilli designing a database schema to help streamline
the CFW operation.

This repository contains files related to that.

As CFW currently has some data in [FileMaker][Filemaker Web] databases, our initial effort
is on using that tool.

However, it seems fairly proprietary which has prompted me to try other tools.

I'm curious about using [LibreOffice Base][Base Guide], connected to an open relational
database such as [Firebird][Firebird docs], [MySQL][mysql docs] or [MariaDB][mariadb docs].

In addition I'm trying [SQL Power Architect][SQL Power Architect download] for designing the database
schema which I hope will help make it easy to implement that schema on various SQL databases.
